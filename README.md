# Clean Code : TDD

## THE THREE BASIC RULES

Uncle Bob describes three basic rules that will help us to write many tests and it will give us a routine to see more clearly how to start if you are new to TDD.
1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and compilation failures are failures.
3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.\

Following these three rules of the production code, which is responsible for making work the application, always progresses hand in hand with the tests. But do it is not easy. So here are other tips on how your TTD code should look, and principles on what you could help to make all this a little easier to understand.
